## Vocabulary
```{r}
# A **variable** is a quantity, quality, or property that you can measure.

# A **value** is the state of a variable when you measure it. The value of a variable may change from measurement to measurement.

# An **observation** is a set of measurements made under similar conditions (you usually make all of the measurements in an observation at the same time and on the same object). An observation will contain several values, each associated with a different variable. I’ll sometimes refer to an observation as a data point.

# **Tabular** data is a set of values, each associated with a variable and an observation. Tabular data is tidy if each value is placed in its own “cell”, each variable in its own column, and each observation in its own row.

# **Variation** is the tendency of the values of a variable to change from measurement to measurement.

# A variable is **categorical** if it can only take one of a small set of values.
  # use a bar chart

# A variable is **continuous** if it can take any of an infinite set of ordered values. Numbers and date-times are two examples of continuous variables.
  # You can compute this by hand by combining dplyr::count() and ggplot2::cut_width():
